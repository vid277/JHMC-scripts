# JHMC-scripts
Backend scripts and website of the 2024 Junior High Math Competition

## About
The Junior High Math Contest hosts over 500 students each year in a day-long math competition.

This code is made for the updated 2024 JHMC Competition, which is online due to the COVID-19 pandemic. To see it live, clone the repo and run `nodemon index.js`. 

## Purpose
We're open-sourcing the platform that we use for virtual contests because we deeply
believe that middle school mathematics opportunities ought to be accessible, engaging,
equitable, and inclusive. We want to make sure that if anyone else wants to host
their own virtual math competition that web development isn't what stops them from
getting challenging contests to the wider masses.
